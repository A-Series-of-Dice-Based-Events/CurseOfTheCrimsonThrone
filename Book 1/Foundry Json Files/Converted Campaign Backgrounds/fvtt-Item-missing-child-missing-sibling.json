      "value": "<p>You suspect that a child you know has been abducted by Gaedren. Whatever the relationship, you've heard rumors about Gaedren's \"Little Lamms,\" and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You've even heard rumors that the child you're looking for has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of other known to be cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the :Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, yet it has its hands full with \"more important\" matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims-that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The missing child is a brother or sister. Although everyone else has given up hope, you believe your sibling still lives out there. Your constant search for the missing sibling has developed into great skill at rumor mongering and finding information from others.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Wisdom</strong> or <strong>Intelligence</strong>. The other is a free boost.</p>\n<p>You are trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Korvosa Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Hobnobber]{Hobnobber} skill feat.</p>"
