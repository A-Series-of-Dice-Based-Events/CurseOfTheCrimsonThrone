      "value": "<p>You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren's enslaved orphans. Maybe you were abducted from your parent's home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed loan of money. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be \"a little light work.\" Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of his \"Little Lamms\" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge for the old man ever since.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gaedren tortured you and left you for dead on a garbage heap after you made one too many errors. Your scars and memories have honed your reaction speed and make you rather jumpy.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to <strong>Dexterity</strong> or <strong>Constitution</strong>. The other is a free boost.</p>\n<p>You are trained in the Thievery skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Pickpocket]{Pickpocket} skill feat.</p>"
