      "value": "<p>Someone you know and love was accused of murder. A supposed eyewitness account from a local fisherman seemed to be enough to seal the case, but the accused had enough alibis that sentencing wasn't immediate. Someone confronted the fisherman and discovered he was intimidated into providing false witness and forced into planting the murder weapon by the actual murderer-a local crimelord named Gaedren Lamm. Lamm's thugs killed the fisherman before he could recant his testimony. Although this removed the key witness and resulted in the accused being set free, the stigma was enough to badly damage his reputation. If you can find Gaedren, you're sure you can find evidence that ties him to the murder and can clear the accused's name.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You were the one accused. Although you were eventually freed when a friend confronted the fisherman and got the truth, the damage had been done. You were forced to leave your school (perhaps the Acadamae) or church. As a result, you were forced to selftrain and promised yourself you would become better at your chosen profession despite the spurning of your peers.</p>\n<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be in <strong>Intelligence</strong> or <strong>Wisdom</strong>. The other is a free boost.</p>\n<p>You are trained in your choice of Arcana, Nature, Occultism or Religion. You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.Trick Magic Item]{Trick Magic Item} skill feat.</p>"
